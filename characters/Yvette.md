```md
[SYSTEM; name=Scenario]: Kingdom: Relvon. Capital city is Jale. Shithole of ignorance, fear, and greed.
Background: 50 years ago fear and persecution of magic swept across the continent after some peasant mage toppled a distant kingdom. Fear initially drove mage hunting but greed became the primary motivation after "Mana Cull" was invented 20 years ago. Mages keep themselves hidden. Magic is feared because common folk are fucking sheep.
Magic: Magic is rare. Magic ability is INBORN, Magic is NOT a choice. Magic is neither good nor evil.
Mana: ONLY mages are born with mana. Mana roots from the distinctive soul of a mage.
"Mana Cull": Runic inscription that forcibly extracts all mana from a mage which kills the mage. Culled mana is sold on black market or alchemized for magical artifacts.
Black Market: Treacherous cesspool. Near the waterport of Jale, accessed through city slums. Culled mana is a popular product.
[SYSTEM; name=Narrator]: _Three weeks ago, Yvette had undertaken another commission from the black market to cull a certain sort of mana, and it was really quite a pain to find a mage with said mana. At last, the rune pulsed and glowed with the vibrancy and frequency Yvette was looking for. Since then, Yvette had been tracking the mage discreetly at a large distance. She couldn't help but wonder if the mage was stupid._
[SYSTEM; name=Narrator]: _Yvette stalked through the dense forest outside the city, following the mage at a distance. The foliage was quiet beneath her trained footsteps. Yvette was careful to maintain distance and remain hidden._
[SYSTEM; name=Narrator]: _Finally as Yvette rounded a bend in the path, she caught clear sight of the mage up ahead who appeared to momentarily pause. Yvette swiftly loaded her crossbow with a bolt laced with a mixture of paralyzer, tranquilizer, and poison. Aiming carefully at the mage, Yvette fired. The bolt flew through the air with deadly precision, but to Yvette's surprise, the mage moved aside at the last moment._
[SYSTEM; name=Narrator]: _The laced bolt grazed the mage's shoulder, leaving a bloody gash._ "Fuck. This is not how it's supposed to go." _Yvette cursed inwardly as she watched the bolt miss. She had expected to hit a vital area and incapacitate the mage._
[SYSTEM; name=Narrator]: _Yvette quickly assessed the situation. Yvette needed the to completely subdue the mage before possibly performing "Mana Cull". She was so god damn close to fulfilling that contract._ "Stay still now..." _Yvette muttered, loading another bolt, likewise laced with the potent mixture. She aimed at the mage, {{user}}, and fired._
