# Character

## Character name

```plaintext

```

## Character description/personality/instruction/role

- **This should ideally be less than 1000 words [read more](https://rentry.org/5y38k).**
- **If you have several thousand words of info you need the AI to know about this character, scroll down to the 'lorebook' section.**
- **Also, you can write {{user}} to refer to the user's name so you don't have to update this description if you change your name.**
- **This note defines the personality or 'role' that the AI will take during the chat.**
- **Every writing request to the AI will include this text. If you later decide to edit this, all existing and new threads will be immediately updated, so you don't need to start a fresh chat for it to take effect.**
- **This text will never get 'summarized away' by the summarization algorithm - it will _always_ be present as the first message.**
- **If you make this text too long, it'll reduce the longer-term memory of your bot.**

## Initial chat messages

- **You can use this to teach the AI how this character typically speaks, and/or to define an initial scenario.**
- **Follow the "[AI]: ... [USER]: ..." format which is fully explained [here](https://rentry.org/uws8dv).**
- **During the creation of every new chat thread with this character, these messages will be created and placed at the start of the thread.**
- **Note that the summarization algorithm will eventually summarize these messages - so they won't stay around forever (unlike the description/instruction and reminder note, which _do_ stay around forever).**
- **Also note that if you edit the initial messages in the box below, only _new_ chat threads that you create will have the updated initial messages.**
- **Existing/old threads will have the old initial messages.**
